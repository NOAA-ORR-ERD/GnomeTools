#################################

Enclosed is a python package of assorted scripts and utilities that can be used to post-process output from the General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME). Soem of these utilities are useded with GNOME1 (the desktop GUI version), some with py_gnome, and some with both/either.

It's not very well structured, but  their may be useful stuff in here.
